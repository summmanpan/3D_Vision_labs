    "# Lab 6: Sructure from motion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "The goal of the current assignment is to learn the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to self-calibrate a camera using vanishing points.\n",
    "- What are the main elements of an incremental structure from motion approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Structure fron Motion problem (SfM) is defined as the 3D reconstruction from a set of unordered and uncalibrated images. There are different SfM approaches: global, hierarchical or incremental. In this lab we will focus on the incremental SfM, which is the most popular strategy for 3D reconstruction from unordered and uncalibrated photo collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incremental SfM is a sequential processing pipeline with an iterative component. It starts working from two views, from which motion (camera parameters) are initialized, and then the structure (3D reconstruction) is also initialized. Right after, an iterative extension of both the motion and the structure is performed, progressively adding new cameras/views and 3D points. A further refinement of both the camera matrices and the reconstructed point cloud is carried out. This last step is known as Bundle Adjustment and it involves solving an optimization problem by iterative techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to familiarize with the structure from motion problem and work with the main blocks that constitute a basic (vanilla) incremental SfM algorithm, without the refinement step. A more complete and robust SfM pipeline would include -- a part from the bundle adjustment --  a carefully selection of the two initial views and each next new view to incorporate, filtering of outliers,  and some other tricks [3]. If you are interested in a more complete solution here we provide a list of some of the most known libraries and softwares:\n",

    "The solution of the structure from motion strongly relies on point correspondences (matchings) across the different views, commonly known as feature tracks. Then, one of the first things to do is feature extraction and matching, followed by geometric verification to remove outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in previous labs, we will be using ORB / SIFT for estimating keypoints and matchings between pairs of images.  These matchings will contain outliers; these can be filtered by robustly estimating a fundamental matrix. Moreover, the fundamental matrix that relates the two initial views will be used to estimate the camera parameters (motion) of these two views.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1.** Robustly estimate the fundamental matrix (F) that relates views 1 and 2, and views 1 and 3. To compute F use the python function cv2.findFundamentalMat, take a close look at the documentation before using it (which are the inputs and what dimesion they should have). For each case, display the inlier matchings together with the pair of images.\n"

    "## Initial two-view reconstruction and self-calibration\n",
    "In lab 5 we saw how to recover the motion between a pair of calibrated cameras. In SfM cameras are not calibrated, but different self-calibration techniques can be applied for estimating the intrinsic parameters.\n",
    " \n",
    "In case we work with images of man-made environments, like urban or indoor scenes, it is possible to estimate vanishing points of orthogonal directions. Vanishing points are useful for self-calibration because they allow us to establish constraints on the internal parameters of the camera (intrinsics). There are different methods in the literature to estimate vanishing points. For example, the following ones are implemented in Matlab:\n",

    "\n",
    "We will assume square pixels (aspect ratio of 1), zero skew factor and principal point at the center of the image, which is common in most commercial cameras.  Then, the only remaining unknown in the matrix of internal parameters is the focal length $\\alpha$, but it can be estimated using a pair of vanishing points as we will explain now (see also Section 6.3.2 of Szeliski's book [5]). \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the previous assumptions, the camera calibration matrix, $K$, can be written as: <br>\n",
    "$$ K=\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & 0 & c_x \\\\ 0 & \\alpha & c_y \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "where the only unknown is $\\alpha$, since $c_x = \\frac{w}{2}$ and $c_y = \\frac{h}{2}$, being $w$ and $h$, respectively, the image width and height in pixels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that we have detected two or more orthogonal vanishing points, all of which are finite, i.e., they are not obtained from lines that appear to be parallel in the image plane. The projection equation for the vanishing point $\\mathbf{v}_1$ corresponding to the cardinal direction $(1, 0, 0)^T$ can be written as\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{v}_1 \\sim K  \\begin{pmatrix}\\mathbf{r}_1 & \\mathbf{r}_2 & \\mathbf{r}_3 & \\mathbf{t} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = K \\mathbf{r}_1$$\n",
    "If we denote the coordinates of the vanishing point $\\mathbf{v}_1$ as $x_1$ and $y_1$ we have:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{r}_1 \\sim K^{-1} \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\alpha & 0 & -c_x/\\alpha \\\\ 0 & 1/\\alpha & -c_y/\\alpha \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \n",

    " \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 - c_x \\\\ y_1 -c_y \\\\ \\alpha \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "And in general, for the vanishing point $\\mathbf{v}_i$, $i=1,2,3$, corresponding to one of the cardinal directions (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), or (0, 0, 1) respectively, and $\\mathbf{r}_i$ being the $i$th column of the rotation matrix $R$ we have:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{r}_i \\sim  \\begin{pmatrix} x_i - c_x \\\\ y_i -c_y \\\\ \\alpha \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "From the orthogonality between columns of the rotation matrix, we have:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{r}_i  \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_j = (x_i - c_x)(x_j - c_x)+(y_i - c_y)(y_j - c_y)+ \\alpha^2 =0, $$\n",

    "$$ \\alpha = \\sqrt{-(x_i - c_x)(x_j - c_x)-(y_i - c_y)(y_j - c_y)}.$$\n",
    "Then, it is possible to estimate $\\alpha$, and thus $K$, using two vanishing points corresponding to orthogonal directions. In our case, all the images have been taken with the same camera, so all of them will share the same $K$.\n",
